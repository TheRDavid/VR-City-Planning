# VR-City-Planning

- Never work on master directly
- Title your commits and branches appropriately (https://github.com/erlang/otp/wiki/writing-good-commit-messages)
- Always create a new branch for your changes (never work on master)
- Always ask for peer review when merging your code to master (never change master willy-nilly)
- Always merge master into your branch before merging into master (never merge outdated code into master!)
- Always reject pull requests that contain debug lods
- Also never work on master directly
